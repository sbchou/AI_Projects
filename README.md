1. Isolation Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of Isolation, a rather boring boardgame.

This demonstrates basic Game Theory concepts using the Minimax Game-Playing algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. (More info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)

Extra parameters for class purposes include: computational time limit, undo capacity
